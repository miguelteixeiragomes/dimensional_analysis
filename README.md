# Dimensional Analysis Library

This library implements compile time dimensional analysis in C++ through template meta-programming. The library defines template classes matching C++'s arithmetic built-in types whose template argument is the dimensions.

## Getting started

The library is composed only of header files, and was tested on MS Visual C++ 14 and GCC 7.2. To use the library simply include the file 'dimensional_analysis.h'
